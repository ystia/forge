    # Using a service that is not defined in this Topology.
    # This is done by specifying an Abstract Node Type that will be matched 
    # at deployment time against the service implementation.
    # This service can be :
    # - either an external service manually declared,
    # - or a service exposed by a deployed application, that specifies a
    #   a substitution mapping betwen the abstract node type referenced below
    #   and the application.
